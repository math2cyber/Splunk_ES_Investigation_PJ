<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
The detection occurred on July 18, 2023 at 9:08 AM.  Splunk labeled the detection as Remote Desktop Network Bruteforce.  The rule that was triggered states this search looks for RDP application network traffic and filters any source/destination pair generating more than twice the standard of the average traffic.  Through the investigation, it was determined the source IP address is malicious.  I queried Splunk to check for previous activity to make sure the attacker was not successful in logging into an endpoint in the environment.  The query displayed a table of the activity and revealed the firewall blocked the attacker from entering the environment.

<br />


<h2>IP(s)</h2>
The source IP is 80.xx.88.2xx and the destination IP is the companyâ€™s public IP address.  A threat actor is attempting to brute force the network through RDP.


<h2>Ports </h2>

<b>RDP 3389</b>

<h2>VirusTotal IP Reputation Check</h2>
VirusTotal Risk Score: 13/88 vendors flagged the IP address as malicious.

<h2>Declaration</h2>
The investigation lead to conclude this detection is a true positive non-issue or it is benign because the firewall blocked the traffic.  There is not recommendation at this time.
